* Description
~leaf.el~ is yet another [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].

~leaf~ solves the stress that I feel while using the use-package for 2.5 years.
By developing from scratch, we have a cleaner and more predictable implementation than ~use-package~.

This makes it easy to maintain and add new keywords. (see [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf-keywords.el][leaf-keywords.el]])

~leaf~ has keywords almost identical to ~use-package~, but some of usage of the keywords is different.

The quickest way to solve problem is to use ~macroexpand-1~ to see the unfolded result if it is not what you intended.
And also there are also a number of samples in this README and more in the [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el/blob/master/leaf-tests.el][test file]].

In addition, since it works with Emacs-23, you can use your usual init.el as usual,
even if you are temporarily using fossil-like Emacs on loan.

(Of course, there are not many packages that work perfectly with Emacs-23.
These packages will be installed by the package manager and will probably report an error.

~leaf~ processes this and cancels the configuration for that package.
It then attempts to process the next package.)

Currently, ~leaf.el~ and ~leaf-keywords.el~ has below rich keywords.

* Install
** MELPA
~leaf.el~ and ~leaf-keywords.el~ can install with package.el from MELPA, so sample instration code is below.

In order to work from Emacs-23, the package manager and the key binding manager
that accompanies ~leaf~ must also be developed with the assumption that they will work from Emacs-23.

I have plans to develop it, but it's not finished yet.

Package to be developed
  - [[https://github.com/conao3/feather.el][feather.el]] instead of ~package.el~
  - leaf-key.el instead of ~bind-key~ -> (Achieved! Now ~leaf~ builtin)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (prog1 "leaf"
    (prog1 "install leaf"
      (custom-set-variables
       '(package-archives '(("org"   . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                            ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                            ("gnu"   . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))))
      (package-initialize)
      (unless (package-installed-p 'leaf)
        (package-refresh-contents)
        (package-install 'leaf)))

    (leaf leaf-keywords
      :ensure t
      :config
      ;; optional packages if you want to use :hydra, :el-get,,,
      (leaf hydra :ensure t)
      (leaf el-get :ensure t
        :custom ((el-get-git-shallow-clone . t)))

      ;; initialize leaf-keywords.el
      (leaf-keywords-init)))
#+end_src

** Manual install
Put ~leaf.el~ at any folder added ~load-path~.
Then ~(require 'leaf)~ and use like ~use-pacakge~.

(In this example, you installed/loaded leaf directly, so you can configure ~package.el~ using ~leaf~.)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; add to load-path
  ;; (locate-user-emacs-file "site-lisp/leaf.el")
  ;;  => "~/.emacs.d/local/26.1/site-lisp/leaf.el"

  (prog1 "leaf"
    (add-to-list 'load-path (locate-user-emacs-file "site-lisp/leaf.el"))
    (require 'leaf)

    (leaf package
        :custom ((package-archives . '(("org"   . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                                       ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                                       ("gnu"   . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))))
        :config
        (package-initialize))

    (leaf leaf-keywords
      :ensure t
      :config
      ;; optional packages if you want to use :hydra, :el-get,,,
      (leaf hydra :ensure t)
      (leaf el-get :ensure t
        :custom ((el-get-git-shallow-clone  . t)))

      ;; initialize leaf-keywords.el
      (leaf-keywords-init)))
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Use ~leaf~ in your init.el like ~use-package~.
You declaratively tell the ~leaf~ to configure the package using special keywords.

~leaf~ converts your declaration into Elisp for Emacs to understand, and Emacs executes it to configure the package.

* Customize
- leaf-defaults: Default arguments for all leaf-block.
- leaf-expand-{{keyword}}: If nil, not to expand that keyword.
- leaf-expand-minimally: If nil, disable keywords that are not needed for debugging.

* Syntaxes
All below examples are excerpts from ~leaf-tests.el~.

These examples are defined in the following format.
We expect FORM will be expanded to EXPECT.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (cort-deftest-with-macroexpand TESTCASE-NAME
    '((FORM             ; will be expand by `macroexpand-1'
       EXPECT)          ; expect FORM's expansion will be EXPECT (test by `equal')

      (FORM
       EXPECT)

      ...))

  (cort-deftest-with-macroexpand-let TESTCASE-NAME
      LETFORM
    '((FORM             ; will be expand by `macroexpand-1' in LETFORM
       EXPECT)          ; expect FORM's expansion will be EXPECT (test by `equal')

      (FORM
       EXPECT)

      ...))
#+end_src

* Basic keywords
** none (keyword)
*Unlike use-package*, ~leaf~ will convert to ~nil~ when used without any keywords.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (cort-deftest-with-macroexpand leaf/none
    '(((leaf leaf)
       (prog1 'leaf))))
#+end_src

** :require keyword
If you want to ~require~, you must use the ~:require~ keyword explicitly.

This is ideally the exact opposite of using the ~:no-require~ keyword in the ~use-package~ if you does not want to ~require~ it.

The leaf's ~:require~ keyword is powerful, specify ~t~ to require the package, and specify multi symbols to ~require~ all of them.

Since the priority is lower than that of the conditional branch keyword described later,
it is possible to assign whether to ~require~ or not by the conditional branch keyword.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (cort-deftest-with-macroexpand leaf/require
    '(((leaf leaf
         :init (leaf-pre-init)
         :require t

         (leaf-pre-init)

         (leaf-init)))

      ((leaf leaf
         :init (leaf-pre-init)
         :require nil
         :config (leaf-init))

         (leaf-init)))

         :config (leaf-init))

         (require 'leaf-sub)
         (require 'leaf-subsub)
         (leaf-init)))))
#+end_src

** :package, :ensure keywords
~:package~ provide ~package.el~ frontend.

Because [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf-keywords.el][leaf-keywords.el]] has ~:el-get~ keyword, ~:package~ provide ~package.el~ frontend.

By the mechanism described below, ~:ensure~ is an alias to ~:package~,
you can also use ~:ensure~ as ~:package~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (cort-deftest-with-macroexpand leaf/package
    '(((leaf leaf
         :package t
         :config (leaf-init))

      ((leaf leaf

         (leaf-handler-package leaf leaf-browser nil)
         (leaf-init)))

    ((leaf leaf
       :package (t . pin))
     (prog1 'leaf
       (leaf-handler-package leaf leaf pin)))))

  (cort-deftest-with-macroexpand leaf/handler-package
    '(((leaf macrostep :ensure t)
       (prog1 'macrostep
         (leaf-handler-package macrostep macrostep nil))

       ((leaf-handler-package macrostep macrostep nil)
        (unless
            (package-installed-p 'macrostep)
          (condition-case err
              (progn
                (unless (assoc 'macrostep package-archive-contents)

                            (error-message-string err)))))))))))
#+end_src

** :preface, :init, :config keywords
These keywords are provided to directly describe elisp with various settings that ~leaf~ does not support.

These keywords are provided to control where the arguments expand,
- ~:preface~ expands before the conditional branch keyword (~:if~ ~when~ ~unless~)
- ~:init~ expands after the conditional branch keyword before ~:require~
- ~:config~ expands after ~:require~

You don't need to put ~progn~ because ~leaf~ can receive multiple S-expressions, but you can do so if you prefer it.

** :bind, :bind* keywords
~:bind~ and ~:bind*~ provide frontend for keybind manager.

When defined globally, key bindings and their corresponding functions are specified in dotted pairs.

To set it to a specific map, *place the map name as a keyword or symbol* at the top of the list.

These pair and list can also be used in list.
Note that these require a *symbol with the map name at the top of the list*.

If you omit ~:package~, use leaf-block name as ~:package~ to lazy load.

** :advice, :advice-remove keywords
~:advice~ provide frontend of ~advice-add~, and ~:advice-remove~ provide frontend of ~advice-remove~.

~:advice~ keyword accept list of ~(WHERE SYMBOL FUNCTION)~ or nested it.

You can use all ~WHERE~ symbol such as
(~:around~ ~:before~ ~:after~ ~:override~ ~:after-until~ ~:after-while~ ~:before-until~ ~:before-while~ ~:filter-args~ ~:filter-return~)

~SYMBOL~ is the adviced function symbol, ~FUNCTION~ is advice function symbol or lambda form.

~:advice-remove~ must not specify ~WHERE~ keyword.

* Configure variables keywords
** :custom, :custom-face keywords
Now that the proper Elisp packaging practices have become widely known,
it is a best practice to use ~custom-set-variables~ to customize packages.

*Unlike use-package*, you must specify a dot pair.

You can of course set multiple variables and set the evaluation result of the S expression to a variable.

The value set to ~custom-face~ should also be quoed to emphasize uniformity as ~leaf~.

** :pre-setq, :setq, :setq-default keywords
These keywords provide a front end to just ~setq~, ~setq-default~.

Because there are packages in the world that must be ~setq~ before doing ~require~ them,
the ~:pre-setq~ keyword is also provided to accommodate them.

The argument specified for ~:pre-setq~ is expanded before ~:require~.

You can of course configure multiple variables adn set the evaluation result of some S expression to variable.

* Configure list keywords
** :mode, :interpreter keywords
~:mode~ keyword define ~auto-mode-alist~. Specifies the major-mode to enable by file extension.
~:interpreter~ keyword define ~interpreter-mode-alist~. Specifies the major-mode to enable by file shebang.

If you pass symbol to these keyword, use leaf block name as major-mode.
If you want to specify major-mode, pass dotted pair value.

The ~:disabled~ keyword provides the ability to temporarily ~nil~ the output of that ~leaf~ block.

You can use multiple values for the ~:disabled~ keyword, or multiple ~:disabled~ keyword,
but ~:disabled~ only respects the value specified at the top.

It can also be said that old values can be overridden by described above.

As you can see from the internal structure of ~:disabled~,
you do not need to pass an exact ~t~ to convert it to ~nil~ because it is comparing it by ~unless~.

* System keywords
System keywords enabled by defalts on all leaf-block.

If you disable temporary, pass these keyword to ~nil~,
or add ~nil~ to ~leaf-defaults~ to disable all leaf-block
or set ~leaf-expand-leaf-protect~ to nil.

** :leaf-protect keyword
If the leaf fails at the top of the configuration file,
most of the configuration file will not be read.

Therefore, it simply reports an error and expands the error-handling block
that moves execution to the next leaf-block.

** :leaf-defer keyword
leaf-blocks with ~:bind~ or ~:mode~ can often delay loading or configuration evaluation.

The keywords that enable this feature are defined below and expand as follows

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defcustom leaf-defer-keywords (cdr '(:dummy
                                        :bind :bind*

                                        :hook :commands))
    "Specifies a keyword to perform a deferred load.
  `leaf' blocks are lazily loaded by their package name
  with values for these keywords."
    :type 'sexp
    :group 'leaf)

  (cort-deftest-with-macroexpand leaf/leaf-defer
    '(((leaf leaf
         :commands leaf
         :config (leaf-init))
       (prog1 'leaf
         (autoload #'leaf "leaf" nil t)
         (eval-after-load 'leaf
           '(progn

      ((leaf leaf

       (prog1 'leaf
         (autoload #'leaf "leaf" nil t)
         (leaf-init)))))
#+end_src

** :leaf-autoload keyword
For keywords that set functions, ~leaf~ can auto-expand the autoload expression
enable lazy loading without relying on magic comments, ~;;;Autoload~.

In some cases, you may want to disable this auto-expansion.
(I can't think of that case, but it's provided as a function.)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

We welcome PR! But It is need sign to FSF.

Travis Cl test ~leaf-test.el~ with all Emacs version 23 or above.

I think that it is difficult to prepare the environment locally,
so I think that it is good to throw PR and test Travis for the time being!
Feel free throw PR!

~leaf.el~ creates the intended elisp code from DSL with a simple mechanism.

It is clear what internal conversion is done and it is also easy to customize it.

*** leaf.el mechanism
1. Append ~leaf-defaults~ and ~leaf-system-defaults~ to ~leaf~ arguments.
2. Because ~leaf~ receives arguments too many format, normalize as plist.
   1. Normalize plist by ~leaf-normalize-plist~.
   2. Sort plist by ~leaf-keyword~.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        (:bind
         ("M-s O" . moccur)
         (:isearch-mode-map
          :package isearch
          ("M-o" . isearch-moccur)
          ("M-O" . isearch-moccur-all)))

        ;; => (:leaf-protect (t)
        ;;     :leaf-autoload (t)
        ;;     :bind (("M-s O" . moccur)
        ;;            (:isearch-mode-map
        ;;             :package isearch
        ;;             ("M-o" . isearch-moccur)
        ;;             ("M-O" . isearch-moccur-all)))
        ;;     :leaf-defer (t))
      #+end_src
3. Run normalizer, and process keyword using below variables
   | Variable Name  | Description                                        |
   |----------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | leaf--raw      | The all leaf arguments                             |
   | leaf--name     | The name of leaf-block                             |
   | leaf--key      | The :keyword of current processing                 |
   | leaf--keyname  | The :keyword name as string of current processing  |
   | leaf--value    | The arguments which is current processed           |
   | leaf--body     | The result of the following keywords and arguments |
   | leaf--rest     | The following keywords and arguments               |
   | leaf--autoload | The list of pair ~(fn . pkg)~                      |
4. Apply the normalized values to the keyword specific normalizer.

   The definition is ~leaf-normalize~, overwrite ~leaf--value~.
5. Run conversion process keyword.

   The conversion definition is ~leaf-keywords~, overridden ~leaf--body~
6. Wrap finaly ~leaf--body~ with ~prog1~.

*** Adding new keywords
~leaf~ normalize argument with ~leaf-normalize~, and conversion with ~leaf-keywords~.

So, pushing new element these variable, ~leaf~ can recognize new keywords.

In [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf-keywords.el][leaf-keywords.el]], you can see practical example, and you can PR it.

Note that leaf only contains keywords for packages that come with the Emacs standard,
and that keywords that depend on external packages are added to its repository.

*** Why We support Emacs-22?
+Bundling Emacs-22.1 on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), we support this.+

The Emacs-22 docker image is not available and is not [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el/issues/262][currently being tested]].
So We don't know if it works or not.

If we can get the Emacs-22 docker image, we will resume support for Emacs-22.

Now, ~leaf~ support Emacs-23 or above.

** Migration
*** leaf v2.0 to v3.0
**** Drop bind-key.el support for :bind and faether.el support for :ensure
To make ~leaf~ dependent only on packages that are itself and packages attached to and Emacs,
we have removed the back-end selection for ~bind-key~ and ~leaf-key~ for ~:bind~
and the back-end selection for ~package.el~, ~feathre.el~, and ~el-get~ for ~:ensure~.

You should now use the external package specific keywords, such as
~:bind-key~ and ~:el-get~, ~:feather~, defined in [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf-keywords.el][leaf-keywords.el]].

Therefore, the keyword ~:ensure~ has been changed to ~:package~.
This has no effect because we have defined alias.

*** leaf v1.0 to v2.0
**** Change not to ~require~ by default
In order to realize the philosophy of "Leaf of setting",
we changed it so as not to ~require~ by default.

If you want to request explicitly use the ~:require t~ flag.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; behavior of leaf v2.0
  (leaf foo)
  => (progn)

  (leaf foo :require t)
  => (progn
       (require 'foo))

  ;; behavior of leaf v1.0
  (leaf foo)
  => (progn
       (require 'foo))

  (leaf foo :require t)
  => (progn
       (require 'foo))
